/*
this was a test for the java compiler after installing the jdk
the jdk is : java develepement kit (contains tools)
the jdk contains jre : java runtime envirement (contains libraries) (.jar files) 
and java contains jvm : java virtual machine (runs byte code)

in java .. source code is being compiled to 'byte code' using the command javac 'filename.java'
byte code files have the extension '.class' which can be run on any other operating system
other system are going to transform the byte code to machine code using the command java 'filename'
